Fourth lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester.

* Frank Hertz main.py contains all of the data anaylsis code used in the experiment. It is worth noting that I went significantly beyond what
was required for the analysis by fitting polynomial functions to each local minima of the recorded data. This earned me 97.5% in the experiment and was also an opportunity to try a new method of analysis.
* Frank Hertz Lab Script.pdf contains a breif outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Frank Hertz Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
* Frank Hertz Lab Report.pdf contains my written up lab report from after the experiment.
