# Franck-Hertz
## Summary 
Fourth lab experiment from my second year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester.

The aim of this experiment was to recreate the famous Franck Hertz experiment to investigate the energy structure of atomic Mercury and Neon. As an extension, polynomials were fitted to the energy spectra to get a more accurate estimate of the turning points.

## Technical Highlights
* Chi-Square minimisation to fit non linear functions
* Data visualisation on matplotlib


## Files
* Frank Hertz main.py contains all of the data anaylsis code used in the experiment. It is worth noting that I went significantly beyond what
was required for the analysis by fitting polynomial functions to each local minima of the recorded data. This earned me 97.5% in the experiment and was also an opportunity to try a new method of analysis.
* Frank Hertz Lab Script.pdf contains a brief outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Frank Hertz Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including a schematic diagram, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
* Frank Hertz Lab Report.pdf contains my written up lab report from after the experiment.
